# image-hyrbid
This is a simple project on basic concepts of computer vision

This project contains 3 separate parts:

1. Imporve Image Contrast:
- Through a different number of models such as gamma correction, histogram equalization, etc. I experiment in order to raise the image's contrast and plot the corresponding chart.
2. Basic denoising methods with given images
3. Creating hybrid images using blurry and sharp images through Gaussian filter.
